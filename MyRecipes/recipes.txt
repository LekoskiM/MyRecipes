Although they don't puff up as much as oven-baked puff pastry, they turn out crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, and they take only minutes to make. Serve hot or at room temperature with syrup, fruit, Nutella®, fruit preserves, or nut butter.","ImageUrl":"https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/3374022.jpg","Ingredients":"Ingredient 1, Ingredient 2","Directions":"Cook, Eat"},{"Id":2,"Title":"Tennessee Meatloaf","Description":"My Grandmother 'Nanaw' Rowan made the most delicious meatloaf in the state. When she passed away, she didn't leave me her recipe, but she left me the desire to recreate it. I think this is it, in flavor and texture. Don't let the number of ingredients discourage you. It's part of the magic in creating a masterpiece!","ImageUrl":"https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.media-allrecipes.com%2Fuserphotos%2F1092268.jpg&w=596&h=596&c=sc&poi=face&q=85","Ingredients":"Ingredient 3, Ingredient 4","Directions":"Cook, Eat"}]
